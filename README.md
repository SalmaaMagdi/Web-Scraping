🌐 Web Scraping Project – Product Data Extraction
📁 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to extract structured product data from a website using web scraping techniques in Python. The goal is to automate data collection for use in analysis, reporting, or building datasets for machine learning and business insights.

🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
Python – Core language for scripting

BeautifulSoup – Parsing HTML content

requests – Sending HTTP requests

pandas – Storing and manipulating extracted data

(Optional): Jupyter Notebook – For interactive development and testing

🔍 Project Objectives
Access a target product listing webpage

Extract key product details such as:

Product Name

Price

Rating

Availability

Organize the data in a structured format (DataFrame)

Export the data to CSV for further use

⚙️ How It Works
Send Request: The script sends a request to the webpage using the requests library.

Parse HTML: Uses BeautifulSoup to navigate and extract specific tags and attributes.

Extract Data: Retrieves the required fields (e.g., names, prices, ratings).

Store in DataFrame: All data is collected in a clean pandas DataFrame.

Export: Optionally exports the data to a CSV file.

📊 Sample Use Cases
Competitor price monitoring

E-commerce product analysis

Dynamic data collection for ML models

Market trend tracking

🚧 Limitations & Considerations
Ensure the target site allows scraping (check robots.txt and terms of service).

Some sites use JavaScript to load data (requires Selenium or APIs).

For large-scale scraping, implement delays and user-agent rotation to avoid blocking.

✅ Output
Clean and structured dataset ready for:

Analysis in Excel or Power BI

Feeding into dashboards

Storing in SQL or NoSQL databases
